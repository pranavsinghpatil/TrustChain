You can now create tenders in development mode without needing real blockchain contracts. The data will be stored in your browser's localStorage, making it easy to test and develop the application.

When you're ready to deploy to production with real contracts, the code will automatically switch to using the blockchain contracts instead of localStorage.

This approach gives you the best of both worlds - easy development without blockchain dependencies, and seamless transition to real blockchain interactions when needed.
